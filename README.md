# Identifying Activity of Humans using CNN with Auto-Encoders and LSTM
Recognizing a person's activities has been a critical Time series classification problem that includes predicting Human movements based on sensor data. The conventional 
approach using Machine learning algorithms requires in-depth domain knowledge for signal processing to the correct construction of features from raw data. This paper 
proposes deep learning approaches for Human activity recognition with data from sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. 
The Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) with the ability of automatic feature extraction, autoencoders(AEs) used for dimensionality reduction, and Long short-term 
memory(LSTM), which are good at temporal modeling, complement each other. In this work, we would like to leverage the complementarity of CNNs, AEs, and LSTMs by 
integrating them into a unified architecture.
